# CookinTime
A React Native app that finally makes food wait for you and not the other way around. The goal of this project is to allow everyone to be able to cook food with only the ingredients they have at home and to allow everyone to be a cook and get a decent dividend in return.   
  
Everyone has their own way of making a certain dish, their own way of cutting groceries, their own way of aging meat, their own way of marinading ingredients and their own way that makes the food truely master chef worthy.  
  
1. Why must only a select few individuals be able to make money out of it?  
2. Why not give eveyone an equal opportunity?  
3. Why not reach everyone to their own unique taste pallets from their own set of ingreidents?

These are the few questions I look forward to tackle as I and my team continue to work on this App
